# Compact Temporal Graphs

This project aims to implement temporal graphs using compact data structures (CDS).
The goal is to implement several versions (v0, v1 ...) in which each version will 
use different sets of CDSs in its implementation, which we'll then compare memory and time efficiency in each of them.

## Setup

The chosen compiler for this project is Google's `bazel`. Please [install bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html)
before following the next steps.
